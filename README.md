# Sentiment-analysis
This script analyzes YouTube video comments for sentiment. It extracts the video ID from a URL, fetches comments via the YouTube API, filters for relevance, and uses VADER for sentiment analysis. Results are saved to a file, and a bar chart visualizes the sentiment distribution of positive, negative, and neutral comments.
